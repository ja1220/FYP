The user could run the total simulation by typing “run xxx.txt” in CAMSET simulator in, denoted as “set.exe”. “xxx.txt” refers to the configuration text file of the transistor. Figure demonstrates a model file of transistor, where each electrical component is required to be defined in magnitude and location, expressed in “def” command and “put” command respectively. Then, the simulation is run by iteration loop by “for” command, with “next” in the end. Finally, the data output is written in “plot” command, which are confined into an output file by “plotfile” command.
